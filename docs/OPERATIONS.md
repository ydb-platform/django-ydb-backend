The backend compiles the Django ORM into YDB's YQL dialect, adapting to the
features of a distributed database. This page covers query support, query
parameters, and UPSERT.

## ORM query features

Legend: ✅ supported · 🟡 works with caveats (see the note) · ❌ unsupported or
not enforced by YDB.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|:------:|-------|
| CRUD (`create` / `get` / `filter` / `update` / `delete`) | ✅ | |
| Most field lookups | ✅ | `exact`, `in`, ranges, `icontains`, date extraction (`week_day` / `week` / `quarter` / …), and more. |
| Backslash / `%` / `_` escaping in pattern and exact lookups | ✅ | `Substr()` on a text column works; a pattern lookup whose right-hand side is a *nullable* expression is not yet supported. |
| Built-in scalar functions | ✅ | `Pi()`, `Random()`, `Now()` / `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `Upper`, `Lower`, `Substr`, etc. map to YQL built-ins. |
| Coercing lookups (`int`-as-`str`, `date`-as-`str`), regex on NULL / non-string | ❌ | Raise during parameter handling. |
| Correlated subqueries (`Exists` / `Subquery` / `OuterRef`) | ❌ | YDB cannot resolve the outer reference. Non-correlated subqueries work. |
| Aggregation / annotation | 🟡 | Common aggregates and `GROUP BY` work; a few edge cases remain. |
| `union()` | ✅ | |
| `intersection()` / `difference()` | ❌ | Not supported by YDB. |
| UNION with `order_by` / `values_list` ordering | 🟡 | Several orderings are not yet handled. |
| UNION as a subquery / wrapped for `COUNT` | ❌ | Generates invalid SQL. |
| `bulk_create` | ✅ | Reads back generated primary keys. |
| `bulk_update` | 🟡 | Works; partial with database functions, `JSONField`, or multi-table inheritance. |
| `F()`, `Case` / `When` | ✅ | |
| Window functions (`OVER`) | ✅ | Supports `ROWS BETWEEN N PRECEDING / FOLLOWING`. |
| `RANGE BETWEEN N PRECEDING …` (bounded offsets) | ❌ | Only unbounded `PRECEDING` / `FOLLOWING` are supported. |
| `select_for_update()` | ❌ | A no-op — YDB has no row locking (optimistic concurrency). See [Transactions](TRANSACTIONS.md). |
| Insert into a primary-key-only / multi-table-inheritance table | ❌ | Raises `NotSupportedError` — see [Compatibility](SUPPORT.md). |
| `ignore_conflicts=True` | ❌ | Not supported. Use UPSERT (below) for race-free writes keyed on the primary key. |

## Query parameters

YDB requires typed query parameters. The backend infers each parameter's type
from the query that produced it (the field being filtered, the expression, the
related key), so joins, foreign-key filters, `__in`, `F()`, `Case` / `When`,
annotations, aggregate (`HAVING`) filters, and non-correlated subqueries all
work.

## Correlated subqueries

Correlated subqueries are **not supported**. `Exists()` / `Subquery()` with
`OuterRef` reference the outer table from inside the subquery, which YDB cannot
resolve. Non-correlated subqueries — for example `field__in=<queryset>` — work.

## UPSERT

UPSERT (UPDATE or INSERT) writes rows keyed on the **primary key**: a missing
row is inserted, and an existing row has the written columns overwritten while
its other columns are preserved. The backend uses YDB's native `UPSERT INTO`,
which runs as a **single atomic statement** — there is no read-modify-write
step, so concurrent upserts of the same key cannot create duplicates.

### Manager setup

UPSERT is provided by `YDBManager`. Set it as the model's manager:

```python
from django.db import models
from ydb_backend.models.manager import YDBManager


class NFTToken(models.Model):
    contract_address = models.CharField(max_length=42)
    token_id = models.CharField(max_length=78, primary_key=True)
    owner = models.CharField(max_length=42)
    metadata_url = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    last_price = models.FloatField()

    objects = YDBManager()
```

### upsert() and bulk_upsert()

Both accept a model instance or a dict (`bulk_upsert` accepts a list, and may
mix the two) and return the persisted instances:

```python
# Insert: the row does not exist yet.
NFTToken.objects.upsert({
    "contract_address": "0x1a2b3c4d5e",
    "token_id": "12345",
    "owner": "0xAlice123",
    "metadata_url": "ipfs://QmXyZ123",
    "last_price": 1.5,
})

# Update: same primary key — the listed columns are overwritten.
NFTToken.objects.upsert({
    "contract_address": "0x1a2b3c4d5e",
    "token_id": "12345",
    "owner": "0xBob456",
    "metadata_url": "ipfs://QmXyZ456",
    "last_price": 2.5,
})

# Bulk: one statement upserts every row.
tokens = NFTToken.objects.bulk_upsert([
    {"contract_address": "0x11", "token_id": "100", "owner": "0xA",
     "metadata_url": "ipfs://a", "last_price": 10.0},
    NFTToken(contract_address="0x22", token_id="200", owner="0xB",
             metadata_url="ipfs://b", last_price=20.0),
])
```

### Conflict target

UPSERT is always keyed on the primary key. `conflict_target` may be omitted (it
defaults to the primary key) or set to the primary key explicitly; any other
target raises `NotSupportedError`, because YDB has no unique constraints to
match on:

```python
NFTToken.objects.upsert(data, conflict_target="token_id")  # ok — the PK
NFTToken.objects.upsert(data, conflict_target="owner")     # NotSupportedError
```

### Writing a subset of columns

`update_fields` restricts which columns are written; columns left out are
preserved on existing rows. YDB's `UPSERT INTO` requires **every NOT NULL
column** to be present, so `update_fields` may only drop nullable columns —
omitting a NOT NULL column raises `NotSupportedError`.

```python
class InventoryItem(models.Model):
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=20, primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)          # NOT NULL
    reorder_level = models.IntegerField(null=True)   # nullable
    quantity = models.IntegerField()                 # NOT NULL

    objects = YDBManager()


# Writes name + quantity; the nullable reorder_level is left untouched.
InventoryItem.objects.upsert(
    {"sku": "A1", "name": "Widget", "quantity": 9},
    update_fields=["name", "quantity"],
)

# Raises NotSupportedError: omits the NOT NULL column `quantity`.
InventoryItem.objects.upsert(
    {"sku": "A1", "name": "Widget"},
    update_fields=["name"],
)
```
